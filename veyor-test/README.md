# Veyor FE task

## Notes

- Decided to use `react-beautiful-dnd` to implement the drag n drop kanban feature, a choice I quickly regretted as there seems to be some [outstanding issues](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/1756) regarding it's compatibility with Next.js with some hacky workarounds.
- It works but may require a refresh, decided not to re-implement given time constraints
